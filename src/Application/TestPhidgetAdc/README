Generic ADC application for Phidget sensors

| Introduction |
---------------
It is a generic application which can configured from a swiftfox 
application. It has been designed and tested for the Z1 mote. Although, 
this application has been designed for Phidget ADC sensors, any ADC 
sensor which can operate at 3v/5v as input voltage could be used (Generic).

The application reads the raw ADC value from the sensor and transmits it 
to specified destination : mote  or computer via the CC2420 radio or the 
Serial interface respectively.

Apart from sampling and sending the read value to the destination, this 
application does not do any application level computation, it primarily 
meant to serve as a template for designing more evolved applications, and
also evaluating the performance of the sensors.

Application does uses the ../../sensors/phidget_adc driver for sampling 
the sensor.

|API Configuration|
------------------
Swift fox application specification :
TestPhidgetAdc ( uint32_t freq, uint8_t inputChannel, uint8_t netEnable,
                                           uint16_t dest, uint8_t sampleCount )

  - uint32_t freq
    Frequency at which the driver samples the sensor. The application in turn
    reads from the sensor every 2*freq mili seconds.

  - uint8_t inputchannel 
    The refers to input pin of the msp430 micro controller to which the Analog
    sensor has been attached. A value between 0-7 should be specified in the 
    swift fox application.
    For msp430 family the numbers 0,1..7 map to port numbers 6.1 6.2 ... 
    6.7. These are referred to as INPUT_CHANNEL_A0 .. A7
    
    For Z1 
            ports INPUT_CHANNELS_0,2,3,4 supply 5v to the sensor
            ports INPUT_CHANNELS_1,5,6,7 supply 3v to the sensor
  - uint_8 netEnable 
    0 : Send data over the serial port, dest is ignored
    1 : Send data to dest node over wireless network

  - uint_8 dest
    Node id of the destination
  - uint8_t sampleCount
    Number of samples sent per packet.
