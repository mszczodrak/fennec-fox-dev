maxTest Application Module
Author: Marcin Szczodrak

maxTest is a simple testing application. Periodically, this application
sends a message with a value and it waits to lean which of all the nodes
in the network sent a message with maximum value. When the application receives
a message from other motes, it compares the message's value with its own. 
If the value is lower that the motes local value, it sends its value to
the network; if the value is higher, then it saves the value and sends
another message with the value.

Each mote sends a message with the following data structure:

nx_struct maxMsg {
        nx_uint32_t max_value;
};


The application module takes two parameters:

uint32_t val - the value that a mote should send to the network.
		If the value is 0, at the beginning of every period
		the application generates a new random value.
		default value: 0	
uint32_t delay - time delay in ms, when all the motes in the network
		periodically try to find a maximum value
		default value: 0
