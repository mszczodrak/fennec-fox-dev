TelosbSensor Application Module
Author: Marcin Szczodrak

A simple application for TelosB platform.
Periodically, the application collects sensor measuremenets (humidity, 
temperature, light) and sends them to some gateway/sink mote.

A mote that receives a network packet is sensor measurements
sends the application's sensor measurements over the UART.

This application module takes two parameters:
uint16_t dest - is the address of the mote to which the sensor
		measurements should be send to
		default value: 0
uint16_t sampling_rate - is the millisecond delay between consecutive
		rounds of sensors' sampling
		default value: 1024
