CTP (Collection Tree Protocol) Network Module:
Author: Marcin Szczodrak

This is an adaptation of the existing CTP protocol in TinyOS 
into the Fennec Fox protocol stack.

CTP creates a tree network topology. All motes send their
messages to the root of the network tree. 

This network module takes one parameter:
uint16_t root = is the address of the mote in the network
		that is the root of the routing tree. This
		root will collect messages from all the motes
		in the network.
		default value: none
