Trickle Network Module:
Author: Marcin Szczodrak

This is an adaptation of the existing Trickle protocol code in TinyOS
for the Fennec Fox protocol stack.

Trickle disseminates information from one mote into all other
motes in the network.

This network module takes four parameters:
uint16_t low - initial length of the trickle transmission period
		default value: 1

uint16_t high - maximum length of the trickle transmission period
		default value: 1024

uint8_t k - number of the same message transmission during one trickle
		period, which suppresses its own transmission.
		default value: 1

uint8_t scale - how fast the transmission period grows
		default value: 10
